# Designing Bioprocesses

Plan your bioprocessing run. Below is a checklist to help plan the layout:

1. **Type of Culture**
   - Are you doing cell or microbial culture?
   - What is the desired culture volume?
   - What is the desired bioprocessing mode?
     - Chemostat
     - Retentostat
     - Turbidostat
     - Morbidostat
     - Luminostat
     - Stressostat

2. **Liquid Inlets and Outlets**
   - How many liquid inlets and outlets are needed?
   - How can these inlets and outlets be mapped to the multi-port cap?
   - How many pumps are needed, and in which direction should each pump be operating?

3. **Gas Inlets and Outlets**
   - How many air/gas inlets and outlets are needed?
   - How can these inlets and outlets be mapped to the multi-port cap?
   - How many pumps are needed, and in which direction should each pump be operating?
   - What is the source of the gas? Is a Gas Regulator Module required?

4. **Heating**
   - Is heating needed?
   - What is the desired target temperature profile?

5. **Mixing**
   - Is mixing needed?
   - What is the desired stirring or sparging profile?

6. **Lighting**
   - Are lights needed?
   - What intensity and profile are required?

Once the configuration is finalized, proceed to connect up the base module(s) and other module(s). Next, proceed to Eggsbee Online to allocate the resources. The user needs to enter the configuration as the Required Resources while the actual connection is automatically read as Available Resources.
