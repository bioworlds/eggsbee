# Automated Control with Eggsbee Online: A Comprehensive Guide

## Understanding the Project Concept

A **Project** in Eggsbee Online represents an all-inclusive and systematic plan for executing, managing, and monitoring specific bio-processes using your Eggsbee devices. It functions as a digital blueprint that outlines every detail - from the required materials to the protocols that should be adhered to, and the automated tasks, referred to as **Jobs**, that the device will execute.

### Project Components

A Project comprises several key components:

1. **Cultures and Support Materials**: These biological components are integral to your bio-processes, examples include cells, microbes, microalgae, mycelia, scaffolds, and microcarriers. The type and quantity of these materials are well-defined and recorded in the Project to ensure ease of future replication.

2. **Growth Media**: This is the specific environment where the cultures will grow or differentiate. The composition of the growth media is meticulously recorded within the Project due to its critical role in the success of the bio-process.

3. **Protocols**: These are detailed instructions or tasks designed to achieve the desired outcomes of the bio-process. The protocol serves as a roadmap that the Eggsbee device adheres to during the Project execution.

4. **Jobs**: These are user-defined tasks automated by the Eggsbee device. Jobs are typically triggered based on specific conditions related to parameters measured by the Eggsbee device, allowing efficient real-time responses to any deviations.

### Data Management

During the progression of a bio-process, the Eggsbee device continuously collects data from its sensors and streams it in real-time to the cloud, storing it in a CSV file. This real-time data allows you to monitor the process as it happens, while also providing a comprehensive dataset for post-process analysis.

This data is accessible at any point and can be processed using your preferred tool. You can also open the CSV file in applications like Google Sheets or Office365 Excel to visualize, analyze, and share the data. Such robust data management fosters scientific collaboration and advancement by allowing high levels of transparency and reproducibility in the bio-process.

### Privacy Modes

By default, a Project in Eggsbee Online is private, meaning only you and any users you add to the Project can access its contents and data. However, if you wish, you can activate Public mode, making all Project contents and data viewable to the entire Eggsbee Online community. This feature promotes an open-source approach and facilitates collaborative progress and innovation.

## Exploring Specific Project Tabs

Each Project on Eggsbee Online is represented by a specific **Project Page**, which serves as the main hub for all information and data related to a particular project. The Project Page is organized into various sections dedicated to different aspects of the project.

### Navigating the Project Page

The layout of the Project Page ensures easy navigation. It includes:

1. **Protocols**: This section details the step-by-step guide that the Eggsbee device follows during the execution of the Project.

2. **Cultures and Support Materials**: Here you'll find detailed information about the biological materials used in the project.

3. **Growth Media**: This section provides information about the environment in which the cultures will grow, including the composition of the growth media and any necessary supplements.

4. **Jobs**: This is where all automated tasks are defined, scheduled, monitored, and analyzed.

5. **Data**: This section provides access to the real-time and historical data collected by the Eggsbee device throughout the project.

### Interacting with the Project Page

The Project Page isn't just a static display of information. Users can interact with different sections to edit protocols, modify job parameters, download data, and more. For instance, in the Jobs section, users can define new jobs, edit existing ones, or deactivate jobs that are no longer required.

### Collaborative Features of the Project Page

The Project Page is also designed to foster collaboration. The owner of the project can invite other Eggsbee Online users to join the project, granting them access to view, edit, or manage the project based on the level of permissions granted.

In Public mode, the Project Page can be viewed by anyone in the Eggsbee Online community, promoting an open-source approach. Users can learn from each other's projects, replicate successful bio-processes, and even collaborate on shared goals.

#### Understanding Jobs

Jobs refer to specific tasks or sets of tasks that the Eggsbee device is programmed to execute. Jobs form the core of project management on Eggsbee Online, with a job's creation involving naming the job, defining its tasks, setting the timeline, and assigning the job to a device.

Once a job is created, you can schedule it to run immediately or at a future date and time. Jobs can run in a specific order or in parallel with other jobs, depending on the requirements of the project. After the job starts, its status can be monitored and managed from its dedicated page. Upon completion, job results, which include data such as temperature logs, humidity levels, and growth curves, can be analyzed and downloaded for further analysis.

## Starting and Stopping Projects

Explains the process of starting and stopping projects, detailing what happens to the project resources and data recording during these phases.

### Initiating a New Project

Starting a new project in Eggsbee Online begins on the platform's user interface, where the option to 'Start New Project' is prominently displayed. Clicking this button will open a new, blank Project Page. Here, you will enter the project's name, its description, the desired start date, and any other relevant details. You then proceed to fill out the specific sections like protocols, cultures, growth media, and jobs as per the requirements of your project.

### Preparing the Eggsbee Device

Once the project has been set up on the platform, the next step involves preparing the Eggsbee device. This requires loading the necessary cultures, growth media, and other reagents into the device as per the project specifications. The user then syncs the device with the online project, allowing it to understand and execute the defined protocols and jobs.

### Starting the Project

With the preparation complete, the project can be officially started. This is done by clicking the 'Start Project' button on the Project Page. Once initiated, the Eggsbee device begins executing the defined jobs based on the protocols specified. The status of the project changes to 'Active', and the device starts collecting and uploading data to the Project Page.

### Monitoring the Project

After the project has started, the user can monitor the progress in real-time through the Eggsbee Online platform. The 'Data' section of the Project Page displays graphs and charts of the collected data, which are updated in real-time. Users can also adjust parameters or protocols mid-project based on the observed data.

### Stopping the Project

There are multiple scenarios where a project might need to be stopped. The user can manually stop the project at any time by clicking the 'Stop Project' button on the Project Page. Alternatively, the Eggsbee device will automatically stop the project if it reaches a defined endpoint, if it encounters a critical error, or if it runs out of necessary reagents.

### Post-Project Actions

Once a project is stopped, its status changes to 'Completed'. The user can then review the data, draw conclusions, and decide on next steps. The Project Page remains accessible for future reference or for sharing with others. The Eggsbee device can be cleaned and prepared for the next project.

#### Understanding Post-Project Actions

Post-Project Actions refer to the actions and tasks you perform after a project has been completed on Eggsbee Online. These actions are an essential part of the project lifecycle, ensuring that the results of a project are properly recorded, analyzed, and used to inform future projects.

##### Data Analysis and Report Generation

One of the first post-project actions involves analyzing the data generated by the project and generating a report. This report typically includes a summary of the project's goals, the methods used, the results obtained, and any conclusions or insights derived from the results. Eggsbee Online's platform provides various tools for data analysis and visualization, making it easier to interpret and understand the project results.

##### Project Archiving

Another important post-project action is the archiving of the project. Archiving involves storing all the project data, including the project setup, the jobs run, and the results obtained, for future reference. This allows you to revisit the project at any time, reviewing the methods used and the results obtained. Archiving also ensures that the project data is preserved, even if the project is no longer active on the Eggsbee Online platform.

##### Sharing and Collaboration

Post-project actions also include sharing the project results with others and collaborating on the interpretation and application of the results. Eggsbee Online facilitates this by allowing you to share project data and reports with other users. This can be useful for collaborative projects, for getting feedback from colleagues or mentors, or for sharing your work with the wider community.

##### Planning Future Projects

Finally, post-project actions often involve using the results of the current project to plan and inform future projects. This could involve refining methods or parameters based on the results obtained, or planning new experiments to further investigate the findings of the current project. By analyzing the results of a project and applying the insights gained, you can continuously improve your work and achieve better results in future projects.
