## Base Module

The key component of the Eggsbee Device is the Base Module, which comprises of a protective shell in which the Vessel is placed. The Base Module is fitted with a number of actuators and sensors for controlling and measuring bioprocesses occurring inside the Vessel. These include:

- A mechanism for operating a rotating magnetic stirrer at variable speeds. The stirring can also be pulsed by using the "Pulse" feature in Eggsbee Online. Currently, there are two versions of the Base Modules, each with different rotating speeds:
  - In the Cell Culture version, the rotating speed is between 10 to 300 rpm
  - In the Microbial Culture version, the rotating speed is between 300 to 3,000 rpm
- One row of white LED lights positioned along the inner wall of the Base Module.
- One row of 8 x optical density sensors positioned along the inner wall of the Base Module. They are positioned from the 100mL to 800mL markings of the Vessel. They can be used as level sensors as well as for measuring the turbidity of the contents of the Vessel.
- A thermal jacket surrounding the Vessel for heating and maintaining the temperature of the Vessel from room temperature to 50 degrees C.
- An infrared sensor to measure the temperature of the contents inside the Vessel.
- In some versions of the Base Module, an Emission Sensor may also be included. This sensor measures the levels of carbon dioxide emissions as well as 8 streams of different volatile organic compounds (VOC). The VOCs provide useful data that can be used for identifying and tracking the bioprocesses through machine learning.

On the outside of the Base Module, there are 3 light indicators:

- The top indicator, when green, indicates that the Eggsbee Device is powered on.
- The middle indicator, when green, indicates that the Eggsbee Device is online. If the indicator is orange, the device is offline.
- The bottom indicator, when green, indicates that bioprocessing data is being recorded.

**Important Notes:** The Base Module must be kept dry at all times. Do not remove the cap and pour liquids into the Vessel when inside the Base Module as accidental spillage may occur. To add liquids into the Vessel, first remove the Vessel, place the Vessel at a safe distance away from the Base Module, remove the cap, pour in the liquids, replace the cap securely, and return the Vessel into the Base Module. Alternatively, the Pump Module may be used to transfer liquids into or out of the Vessel.

## Vessel

The Vessel is provided when the advanced or standard package is purchased. The Vessel is a very important part of the Device as it contains the ingredients, and it is inside the Vessel that the bioprocesses take place. The features of the Vessel are as follow:

- There are 2 types of Vessels:
  - The 1-litre Vessel that can be used from a minimum volume of 100 mL to a maximum volume of 1,000 mL
  - The 500mL Vessel that can be used from a minimum volume of 100mL to a maximum volume of 500 mL.
- The Vessel is made of glass, round, and wide-mouth with GLS80 thread volume.
- The Vessel can be sealed with the orange polypropylene cap or the blue 4-port or 6-port caps. Both Vessel and caps can be safely autoclaved or sterilized by any other conventional means.
- The Vessel comes with permanent white enamel graduations and a marking spot.

**Important Notes:** If desired, the Vessel can be used as a single-use vessel.
