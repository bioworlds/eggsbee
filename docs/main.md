- Emission Sensor (optional): Measures carbon dioxide emissions and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for advanced bioprocess tracking.

### Vessel Features:

- Two Types: 1-liter and 500mL Vessels, with different volume ranges for bioprocessing flexibility.
- Made of Glass: Round, wide-mouthed vessels with GLS80 thread for easy handling and autoclaving.
- Sealing Options: Can be sealed with polypropylene caps, suitable for autoclaving or sterilization.
- Graduations and Marking Spot: Equipped with white enamel graduations and a marking spot for accurate measurements.

## Eggsbee Online

Eggsbee Online is the cloud software that complements Eggsbee Devices, offering a user-friendly interface for bioprocess design, control, and data analysis.

### Key Features:

- Bioprocess Design: Users can design, create, edit, and share bioprocesses using a collaborative and intuitive platform, similar to GitHub for code.
- Deployment and Orchestration: Bioprocess code can be deployed with a single click onto Eggsbee Devices, with automatic provisioning and orchestration.
- Data Analytics: Real-time data streaming enables intelligent control, analytics, and potential AI integration for optimizing bioprocessing performance.

## EggOS - The Intelligent Operating System

Eggsbee Devices are powered by EggOS, the intelligent operating system that provides seamless integration between hardware and software. EggOS ensures smooth and efficient operation of Eggsbee Devices, enabling users to focus on their bioprocessing experiments without worrying about the technicalities.

## Accessory Modules and Accessories

The Eggsbee Ecosystem also offers a range of accessory modules, such as the Pump Module for liquid transfer, and accessories like magnetic stir bars and temperature probes. These additions further enhance the versatility and functionality of Eggsbee Devices, allowing users to tailor their bioprocessing setups to specific requirements.

## The Story Behind the Name Eggsbee

The name "Eggsbee" was inspired by the concept of growth and potential within each device, much like an egg nurturing life within it. It symbolizes the continuous evolution and expansion of bioprocessing capabilities that Eggsbee Devices offer to users. The playful combination of "eggs" and "bee" captures the essence of bioprocessing as a collaborative and dynamic ecosystem, buzzing with activity and innovation.

The Eggsbee Ecosystem is designed to make bioprocessing accessible to a broad audience, including researchers, biotechnologists, students, and enthusiasts. With its modular and intelligent approach, the Eggsbee Ecosystem empowers users to carry out a diverse range of bioprocesses with precision and ease.
