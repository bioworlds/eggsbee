## Eggsbee Ecosystem Overview

The Eggsbee Ecosystem is a cutting-edge bioprocessing solution that revolutionizes the way bioprocesses are conducted. It consists of modular and intelligent bioreactors known as Eggsbee Devices, powered by the advanced operating system EggOS, and integrated with powerful cloud software called Eggsbee Online.

## Eggsbee Devices

Eggsbee Bioreactors are an innovative series of devices designed for carrying out a wide range of bioprocesses. They are compac
t, user-friendly units that can perform a variety of biological experiments and procedures.

The key component of the Eggsbee Ecosystem is the [Eggsbee Base Module](modules/base_module.md), which comprises the Base Module and the [Vessel](accessories/1L_glass_vessel.md). The [Eggsbee Base Module](modules/base_module.md) acts as a protective shell and houses a range of actuators and sensors to control and measure bioprocesses inside the Vessel.

## Purpose of Eggsbee Devices

The primary purpose of Eggsbee Devices is to facilitate and simplify bioprocesses, making these complex procedures more accessible to a broader audience. This includes scientists in research institutions, biotechnologists building pilot plants, students in educational environments, and enthusiasts in a hobbyist context. By providing a portable and compact, yet versatile platform, Eggsbee Devices aim to democratize access to biotechnology for users of varying experience levels, from experts to novices.

## Key Features

Eggsbee Devices are equipped with an array of advanced features to support a diverse range of bioprocesses. This includes control of temperature, mixing, luminosity, aerobic/anaerobic conditions, humidity control, and nutrient delivery systems. These features allow the devices to create highly specific environments that can cater to the growth of a wide array of biological entities, from bacteria to fungi to plant & animal cells.

Moreover, Eggsbee Devices are designed with user-friendliness in mind. The management software, Eggsbee Online, has intuitive interfaces and straightforward operation procedures, making the Eggsbee devices accessible to users of varying experience levels. Plus, they are compact and portable, allowing for their use in a variety of settings.

### Base Module Features:

- Rotating Magnetic Stirrer: Enables precise and variable stirring of bioprocess contents, with options for pulsing using Eggsbee Online.
- White LED Lights: Provide illumination within the Base Module for optimal observation of bioprocesses.
- Optical Density Sensors: Positioned along the inner wall, these sensors measure turbidity and act as level sensors for bioprocess monitoring.
- Thermal Jacket: Surrounds the Vessel, providing precise temperature control from room temperature to 50 degrees C.
- Infrared Sensor: Measures the temperature of bioprocess contents inside the Vessel.
- Emission Sensor (optional): Measures carbon dioxide emissions and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for advanced bioprocess tracking.

### Vessel Features:

- Two Types: 1-liter and 500mL Vessels, with different volume ranges for bioprocessing flexibility.
- Made of Glass: Round, wide-mouthed vessels with GLS80 thread for easy handling and autoclaving.
- Sealing Options: Can be sealed with polypropylene caps, suitable for autoclaving or sterilization.
- Graduations and Marking Spot: Equipped with white enamel graduations and a marking spot for accurate measurements.

### List of Modules:

A key feature in Eggsbee Devices is the availability of several plug and play modules. These modules can be connected to the existing system by powering them up via a USB cable to either the Base Module or to another module that is already powered up. The newly connected module is automatically detected and can be provisioned via Eggsbee Online. Multiple modules can be daisy-chained and connected in series. Similarly, modules can be easily disconnected by unplugging their USB cables.

Current existing modules include:
- [Base Module](modules/base_module.md)
- [Pump Module](modules/pump_module.md): Facilitates liquid transfer and enhances bioprocessing functionalities with accurate and controlled liquid handling.
- [pH Module](modules/pH_module.md): Monitors and controls pH levels during bioprocessing experiments with high-precision sensors.
- [Gas Regulator Module](modules/gas_regulator_module.md): Regulates and controls gas flow during bioprocessing experiments, ensuring precise and stable gas concentrations.

These modules add versatility and functionality to the Eggsbee Devices, empowering researchers and scientists to customize and optimize their bioprocesses according to their specific needs.

## Eggsbee Online

[Eggsbee Online](eggsbee_online/eggsbee_online.md) is the cloud software that complements Eggsbee Devices, offering a user-friendly interface for bioprocess design, control, and data analysis.

### Key Features:

- [Bioprocess Design](eggsbee_online/designing_bioprocesses.md): Users can design, create, edit, and share bioprocesses using a collaborative and intuitive platform, similar to GitHub for code.
- Deployment and Orchestration: Bioprocess code can be deployed with a single click onto Eggsbee Devices, with automatic provisioning and orchestration.
- Data Analytics: Real-time data streaming enables intelligent control, analytics, and potential AI integration for optimizing bioprocessing performance.

## EggOS - The Intelligent Operating System

Eggsbee Devices are powered by EggOS, the intelligent operating system that provides seamless integration between hardware and software. EggOS ensures smooth and efficient operation of Eggsbee Devices, enabling users to focus on their bioprocessing experiments without worrying about the technicalities.

## Accessory Modules and Accessories

The Eggsbee Ecosystem also offers a range of accessory modules, such as the Pump Module for liquid transfer, and accessories like magnetic stir bars and temperature probes. These additions further enhance the versatility and functionality of Eggsbee Devices, allowing users to tailor their bioprocessing setups to specific requirements.
