## Two-Point Calibration Method for pH Sensor in Eggsbee Device <a name="two-point-calibration-method"></a>

### Materials Required

- Eggsbee device
- pH module
- Access to Eggsbee Online
- pH calibration buffers (pH 4 and pH 7 or pH 10)
- Clean container for buffer solutions
- Distilled water
- Tissue or lint-free cloth

### Procedure

#### Step 1: Prepare the Calibration Buffers

1. Obtain pH calibration buffers with known pH values. Use two buffers: pH 4 and pH 7 (or pH 10) for a two-point calibration.
2. Check the calibration buffers' expiration date to ensure their accuracy.
3. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to prepare the calibration buffers, ensuring proper dilution and mixing.

#### Step 2: Preparing the Eggsbee Bioreactor Device

1. Ensure that the pH sensor is properly and securely attached to the Eggsbee device.
2. Confirm that the pH sensor is clean and free from any debris or residue.
3. If needed, gently clean the pH sensor with distilled water and a lint-free cloth.

#### Step 3: Performing the Two-Point Calibration

1. Power on the Eggsbee bioreactor device and access Eggsbee Online. Go to the device drawer to read the pH values.
2. Dip the pH sensor into the pH 4 buffer solution, ensuring the sensor is fully immersed without touching the container walls.
3. Allow a few moments for the pH reading to stabilize, and then record the measured pH value displayed on the device.
4. Rinse the pH sensor with distilled water and gently pat it dry with a lint-free cloth.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 using the pH 7 (or pH 10) buffer solution.
6. Ensure that the sensor is fully rinsed and dried between buffer solutions to prevent cross-contamination.
7. Record the measured pH value for the second buffer solution.

#### Step 4: Calibration Verification

1. Compare the measured pH values with the known pH values of the calibration buffers.
2. If the measured values deviate significantly from the expected values, repeat the calibration process.
3. If the measured values align closely with the expected values, the calibration is successful, and the pH sensor is ready for use.

#### Step 5: Measuring and Calculating pH of a Solution

1. Ensure that the Eggsbee device is properly set up and the pH sensor is connected.
2. Access Eggsbee Online and go to the device drawer to read the pH values.
3. Immerse the pH sensor into the solution whose pH you want to measure, ensuring full immersion without touching the container walls.
4. Allow a few moments for the pH reading to stabilize on the device.
5. Read and record the measured pH value displayed on the Eggsbee bioreactor device.
6. If necessary, repeat the measurement process for multiple samples or at different time points.

#### Calculating pH

To calculate the pH of a solution based on the calibrated values:

1. Subtract the pH value obtained during the two-point calibration (pH buffer 7 or pH buffer 10) from the measured pH value of the solution.
2. Add the corresponding calibration offset to the result. The calibration offset is the difference between the known pH value of the calibration buffer and the measured pH value during calibration (e.g., pH 7 buffer - measured pH during calibration).
3. The resulting value is the pH of the solution.

### Conclusion

Calibrating the pH sensor in the Eggsbee bioreactor device using the two-point calibration method ensures accurate pH measurements during bioprocesses. This user guide helps users maintain precise control over the pH levels, facilitating optimal growth and performance of cultured cells or microorganisms. Regular calibration and process documentation are crucial for reliable and consistent pH monitoring in the Eggsbee bioreactor device. The measured pH values can be adjusted using the calibration offset to calculate the pH of the solution accurately.
