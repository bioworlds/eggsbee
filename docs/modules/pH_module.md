# pH Module Documentation

## Introduction

The pH Module is a critical component of the Eggsbee Ecosystem, specifically designed to monitor and control the pH levels during bioprocessing experiments. This comprehensive documentation provides in-depth instructions on using and integrating the pH Module into your bioprocessing setup.

## Features

- **Precise pH Monitoring**: The pH Module is equipped with high-precision sensors to accurately measure the pH levels of bioprocess solutions in real-time.

- **Automated pH Control**: With its integrated control system, the pH Module can automatically adjust pH levels, maintaining optimal conditions for your bioprocesses.

- **Seamless Integration**: The pH Module seamlessly connects to Eggsbee Devices and Eggsbee Online, allowing for centralized control and data analysis.

- **Calibration Flexibility**: The pH Module offers calibration options, enabling users to tailor the pH measurements to their specific experimental requirements.

## Setup and Installation

1. Connect the pH Module to the Eggsbee Device using the provided connectors.

2. Power on both the Eggsbee Device and the pH Module.

3. Access the Eggsbee Online platform to calibrate the pH Module based on the pH range required for your bioprocessing experiments.

4. Configure the pH setpoints and the desired pH range for the bioprocess.

## Operating Instructions

1. Access Eggsbee Online and select the bioprocess for which you want to monitor and control pH levels.

2. Specify the pH Module as part of the control system in the bioprocess settings.

3. Set the desired pH range and the pH setpoints for the automated control system.

4. Start the bioprocess, and the pH Module will automatically monitor and adjust pH levels as needed during the experiment.

5. Monitor the pH values and control actions through Eggsbee Online during the entire bioprocessing run.

## Maintenance and Care

- Regularly calibrate the pH Module as per the Eggsbee Device user manual guidelines.

- Clean the pH sensor with distilled water after each use to maintain accuracy.

- Handle the pH Module and sensor with care to avoid damage.

- Store the pH Module in a dry and clean environment when not in use.

## Safety Precautions

- Ensure that the pH Module and Eggsbee Device are properly grounded.

- Use appropriate safety measures when working with chemicals and bioprocess solutions.

- Avoid immersing the pH Module in liquid, and only use it for in-line pH measurement.

- Disconnect the pH Module from the power source when not in use.
