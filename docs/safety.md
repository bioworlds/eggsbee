## Biosafety Precautions

- Always work in a designated biosafety cabinet or a clean and controlled environment when handling biohazardous materials.
- Follow all institutional and regulatory guidelines for the safe handling and disposal of biohazardous materials.
- Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab coats, safety goggles, and face masks when working with potentially hazardous substances.
- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after handling biohazardous materials.
- Do not eat, drink, or apply cosmetics in the laboratory to prevent accidental ingestion of hazardous materials.

## Eggsbee Devices Safety Guidelines

- Read and understand the user manual and documentation provided with each Eggsbee Device before use.
- Ensure that all modules and accessories are securely and correctly connected before starting any bioprocessing run.
- Keep the Base Module and all connected modules dry at all times. Avoid exposing them to liquids, as it may damage the internal components.
- Avoid unplugging modules or accessories while the device is in operation to prevent damage to the system and avoid potential spills.
- Do not touch any electrical components or connectors with wet hands.
- Keep the Eggsbee Devices away from direct sunlight and extreme heat or cold.
- Do not modify or tamper with any part of the Eggsbee Devices. Only qualified personnel should perform any repairs or maintenance.

## General Bioprocessing Safety

- Use appropriate sterile techniques when handling cultures or any bioprocessing materials to prevent contamination.
- Follow aseptic procedures when setting up and handling bioprocesses to ensure the integrity of the culture.
- Be cautious when working with high-pressure systems, and always follow the safety guidelines for the use of gas regulators and pressure vessels.
- Handle chemicals and reagents with care, and be aware of their hazardous properties. Always use in a well-ventilated area and wear appropriate PPE.
- Dispose of waste materials according to institutional and regulatory guidelines for biohazardous and chemical waste.
- Regularly inspect and maintain all Eggsbee Devices and modules to ensure proper functionality and safety.

## Emergency Procedures

- In case of an emergency, immediately stop all bioprocessing operations and disconnect power from the Eggsbee Devices.
- In case of a spill or biohazardous material exposure, follow the designated spill response protocol and notify the appropriate personnel.
- If you suspect a malfunction or abnormal operation of the Eggsbee Devices, contact our support team for assistance.

Remember that safety is of utmost importance when working with biological materials and bioprocessing. Always exercise caution and adhere to established safety practices to protect yourself, your colleagues, and the environment.
